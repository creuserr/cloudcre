### :cloud: What is cloudcre?
cloudcre is a web application for downloading music. It uses [Piped](https://piped.kavin.rocks), [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), and [PyTube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) to function.

### :wrench: Troubleshooting
If the audio is not loading, these are the possible reasons:
1. Poor internet connection &ndash; If this happen, check your internet connection and refresh the website.
2. Too much data &ndash; Since I only use the Hobby plan of Vercel, the limit on the size of the audio is `4.5 MB`. This cannot be resolved unless you deploy your own fork with a paid plan.

### :rocket: Deploy it yourself
Deploying your own is just simple. Fork this repository, add some adjustments, and deploy it (recommended service is Vercel). However, there are some extra steps.

1. Create a new repository &ndash; This will be the API for fetching the audio.
2. Set that repository as a serverless Python function and use the gist template [cloudcre: audio api template](https://gist.github.com/creuserr/02fb1127961632120304c1302f47c583).
3. In `index.js`, modify the `getAudio` function with the gist template [cloudcre: index.js template](https://gist.github.com/creuserr/28f9bdc3da7d5309dbb150d77a6a96e6).

If you want to add some features, you can use some of my APIs like [CreQQ](https://github.com/creuserr/creqq) for synchronized lyrics.

#### Tiering system

Tiering system uses the `popularity` score given by Spotify.

> The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
> 
> The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.
>
> *[&mdash; Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-track)*

The lookup table below is how it selects the tier by the given score.

| Tier | Condition |
|:----:|:---------:|
| S+   | >= 95     |
| A+   | >= 90     |
| A    | >= 80     |
| B    | >= 70     |
| C    | >= 60     |
| D    | >= 50     |
| F    | >= 0      |

#### History

Your latest top 10 history will appear on the search tab. It will only appear if your history list has more than 9 items.

`Try these songs` will never appear again unless you cleared your history.
